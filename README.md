 Docker image used for building and testing the [COBC software](https://github.com/SpaceTeam/STS1_COBC_SW) of SpaceTeamSat1.

* The `linux-x86` folder is used to build an image that can only compile to x86 targets, making it much lighter than the full image.
* The `full` folder is used to build for STM32F411 in addition.
